Welcome to the Fletch Takehome by Edward Shei

First of all, thank you for the very fun and interesting take home. I implemented the following features:

**Features**

1.  Clicking on a website in the table will filter the data depending on which cell has been clicked.

2.  I utilized the web address to store the state of what data has been filtered.

3.  This works upon reloading the page
    3a. If this were a live website, users could send users the web address via email or text, and the appropriate filters will be applied.

4.  Please note, that I did not use local storage at all

5.  Please note, I used the minimal amount of libraries to showcase my skills. I did not use MUI, any React pivot table libraries, no css processors like Styled Components, etc.

**Features to Implement**

Unfortunately, my 1.5 year old daughter caught hand, foot and mouth disease this week, and I've been her primary caretaker. This means that I did not have as much time to spend on it this week as I would have liked.

1.  I would have loved to have the time to put additional work into the bare-bones css I created.
2.  I also would have loved to have the time to create charts with Charts.js, a visualization library that I have worked with before.
3.  I would have liked to add other pivots such as sort by sum_bytes, web address, etc.

**To Run**

1. Please open two terminals, and change into this directory.
2. In Terminal 1
   2a. Run npm i
   2b. Run npm run dev
3. In Terminal 2
   3a. Run npm run server
4.  Open up your web browser and navigate to localhost: 5173
